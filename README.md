# CitiBike COVID-19 Analysis

## Overview
This project explores how CitiBike usage patterns in New York City were affected during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020). Using trip data and Tableau, we analyzed differences between casual riders and members, and visualized shifts in ridership behavior.

## Tools & Technologies
