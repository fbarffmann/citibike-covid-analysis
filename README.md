## Key Findings

- Analyzed over 800,000 rides in March 2020.
- COVID-19 drove a shift toward casual riders, increasing their trip volume significantly relative to prior months.
- Popular start stations clustered near parks and residential areas as commuting patterns changed.
- Casual riders took longer, more leisurely rides compared to subscribers.
